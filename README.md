# Hello-World
Just learning how to use GitHub

My first repository, and I'm gonna start with talking a little bit about myself. (If I make some mistakes writing this please forgive me, I'm a self-taught in what english language concerns)
I'm 34 years old and I'm a Mechanical Maintenance Engineer born and raised in Barquisimeto, Venezuela. How everybody's knows we are in the middle of a rough economic-political crisis and anybody canÂ´t denied, until last part of 2021 I was working as a Industrial Refrigeration technician in a large food company, but some issues make impossible to me continue in this job, now I'm unemployed with a 2 year old son and a working wife that provides for all. In between the search for a new job and better opportunities this world of Software Development finds me. I started just searching for what all this is?? what can I do if learn how to code?? and the answer was "You can do anything (almost)" and also you need to be in GitHub. That's why I'm in here, and I will try to give all of you (that wanna join me in this path) a tour in how I'm doing in my journey to become a Software Developer.
